CRITICAL CONCEPT: HOW PHYSICAL MACHINES ARE USED
=================================================

PHYSICAL CLUSTER SETUP:
-----------------------
Imagine you have a cluster with 5 physical machines (nodes):

Node 1: Master Node (ResourceManager in YARN / Master in Standalone)
  - Runs cluster manager software
  - Does NOT run Spark computations
  - Just coordinates resources
  - Specs: 4 cores, 16GB RAM

Node 2-5: Worker Nodes (4 machines for actual work)
  - Each has: 16 cores, 64GB RAM
  - Run executors (Spark JVM processes)
  - Store data partitions in memory/disk
  - Execute tasks in parallel

EXECUTOR PLACEMENT ON PHYSICAL MACHINES:
-----------------------------------------
Q: "Does 1 PC get several executors?"
A: YES! Common pattern:

Worker Node 2 (64GB, 16 cores):
  ├─ Executor 1: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  ├─ Executor 2: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  ├─ Executor 3: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  └─ Executor 4: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  (Leaves ~32GB for OS and other processes)

Worker Node 3 (64GB, 16 cores):
  ├─ Executor 5: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  ├─ Executor 6: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  ├─ Executor 7: 8GB memory, 4 cores
  └─ Executor 8: 8GB memory, 4 cores

... and so on for Worker Nodes 4 and 5

RESULT: 16 executors across 4 physical machines
  - Each machine runs 4 executors
  - Each executor is a separate JVM process
  - Executors share the machine's CPU and memory

WHY MULTIPLE EXECUTORS PER MACHINE?
------------------------------------
1. Better parallelism: Each executor can run multiple tasks
2. Fault isolation: One executor crash doesn't kill others
3. Memory management: Smaller heap = less GC overhead
4. Resource sharing: Better utilization of physical resources

PARTITION DISTRIBUTION ACROSS EXECUTORS:
-----------------------------------------
Q: "Does 1 PC or cloud node get several partitions?"
A: YES! Here's how:

Imagine dataset with 200 partitions, 16 executors:

Worker Node 2 (4 executors):
  Executor 1: Holds partitions [0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192]
  Executor 2: Holds partitions [1, 17, 33, 49, 65, 81, 97, 113, 129, 145, 161, 177, 193]
  Executor 3: Holds partitions [2, 18, 34, 50, 66, 82, 98, 114, 130, 146, 162, 178, 194]
  Executor 4: Holds partitions [3, 19, 35, 51, 67, 83, 99, 115, 131, 147, 163, 179, 195]

Worker Node 3 (4 executors):
  Executor 5: Holds partitions [4, 20, 36, 52, 68, 84, 100, 116, 132, 148, 164, 180, 196]
  Executor 6: Holds partitions [5, 21, 37, 53, 69, 85, 101, 117, 133, 149, 165, 181, 197]
  ... and so on

RESULT: Each physical machine holds ~50 partitions spread across 4 executors
  - Partitions distributed evenly
  - Round-robin or hash-based distribution
  - Goal: Balance load across all machines

SPARK DEPLOYMENT MODES:
=======================

1. CLIENT MODE:
   ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
   │ User Machine │         │  Cluster Manager │
   │              │         │                  │
   │  [Driver] ◄──┼─────────┤  [Executors]     │
   │              │  Network│                  │
   └──────────────┘         └──────────────────┘
   
   • Driver runs on client machine (where you submit)
   • Good for: Interactive work, development, debugging
   • Bad for: Production (network latency, client must stay up)
   • Use case: spark-shell, notebooks, testing

2. CLUSTER MODE:
   ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────────┐
   │ User Machine │         │    Cluster Manager           │
   │              │         │                              │
   │ spark-submit ├────────►│  [Driver] + [Executors]      │
   │  (detached)  │         │   (both run in cluster)      │
   └──────────────┘         └──────────────────────────────┘
   
   • Driver runs inside cluster (on a worker node)
   • Good for: Production, long-running jobs, reliability
   • Bad for: Interactive debugging (no direct access to driver)
   • Use case: Production batch jobs, scheduled workflows

CLUSTER MANAGERS COMPARISON:
=============================

YARN (Hadoop YARN - Yet Another Resource Negotiator):
------------------------------------------------------
Most common in enterprise Hadoop environments

Components:
• ResourceManager (RM): Central authority for resource allocation
• NodeManager (NM): Per-node agent managing containers
• ApplicationMaster (AM): Per-app coordinator (Spark Driver in cluster mode)

Flow:
1. Client submits to ResourceManager
2. RM allocates container for ApplicationMaster
3. AM (Spark Driver) requests executor containers
4. NMs launch executors
5. Executors register with Driver

Pros:
✅ Mature, stable, well-tested
✅ Good multi-tenancy support
✅ Queue-based resource management
✅ Integrates with Hadoop ecosystem

Cons:
❌ Complex setup and configuration
❌ Slower allocation than Kubernetes
❌ Tied to Hadoop ecosystem

KUBERNETES (K8s):
-----------------
Modern container orchestration platform

Components:
• API Server: Central control plane
• Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes
• Kubelet: Per-node agent managing pods
• Pod: Container wrapper (Driver pod + Executor pods)

Flow:
1. Client submits to K8s API Server
2. Scheduler creates Driver pod
3. Driver requests Executor pods via API
4. Kubelets launch Executor pods
5. Executors register with Driver

Pros:
✅ Cloud-native, modern
✅ Fast resource allocation
✅ Auto-scaling support
✅ Better isolation (containers)
✅ Declarative configuration

Cons:
❌ Less mature for Spark
❌ More complex networking
❌ Requires K8s expertise

STANDALONE MODE:
----------------
Spark's built-in cluster manager (simplest)

Components:
• Master: Central coordinator
• Worker: Per-node executor launcher

Flow:
1. Client submits to Master
2. Master allocates resources on Workers
3. Workers launch Executors
4. Executors register with Driver

Pros:
✅ Simple setup (just Spark, no Hadoop/K8s)
✅ Fast allocation
✅ Easy to understand

Cons:
❌ Limited features (no multi-tenancy)
❌ No resource isolation
❌ Single point of failure (Master)

PARTITIONING DEEP DIVE - HOW DATA IS DIVIDED:
==============================================

WHAT IS A PARTITION?
--------------------
A partition is a logical chunk of data that:
• Resides on a single executor
• Is processed by a single task
• Can be cached in memory
• Can be stored on disk
• Is the unit of parallelism

Think of it like slicing a pizza:
  Total Dataset (Pizza) = 1GB
  Number of Partitions (Slices) = 8
  Each Partition (Slice) = ~125MB

HOW ARE PARTITIONS CREATED AND DIVIDED?
----------------------------------------

1. READING FROM FILES (Most Common):
   ------------------------------------
   When reading from HDFS/S3/etc:
   
   Example: Reading 1GB CSV file
   
   spark.read.csv("s3://bucket/data.csv")
   
   WHAT HAPPENS:
   Step 1: Driver queries data source metadata
     - File size: 1GB
     - Block size: 128MB (HDFS default)
     - Number of blocks: 1024MB / 128MB = 8 blocks
   
   Step 2: Driver creates 1 partition per block
     - Partition 0: Bytes 0 to 134,217,728 (128MB)
     - Partition 1: Bytes 134,217,728 to 268,435,456
     - Partition 2: Bytes 268,435,456 to 402,653,184
     - ... and so on for 8 partitions total
   
   Step 3: Driver assigns partitions to executors
     - Executor 1 gets partitions [0, 4]
     - Executor 2 gets partitions [1, 5]
     - Executor 3 gets partitions [2, 6]
     - Executor 4 gets partitions [3, 7]
   
   RESULT: 8 partitions distributed across 4 executors
   
   DATA LOCALITY OPTIMIZATION:
   ---------------------------
   HDFS stores blocks with 3x replication across nodes:
   Block 0 replicas: [node-1, node-3, node-5]
   Block 1 replicas: [node-2, node-4, node-1]
   
   Driver tries to schedule tasks on nodes that already have the data:
   - PROCESS_LOCAL: Data in executor memory (best)
   - NODE_LOCAL: Data on same machine's disk (good)
   - RACK_LOCAL: Data on same rack (okay)
   - ANY: Data on different rack (requires network transfer - slow)

2. READING FROM DATABASES (JDBC):
   --------------------------------
   spark.read.jdbc(url, table, 
                   column="id", 
                   lowerBound=0, 
                   upperBound=1000000,
                   numPartitions=10)
   
   WHAT HAPPENS:
   Step 1: Driver divides range into equal chunks
     - Total range: 1,000,000 IDs
     - Number of partitions: 10
     - Chunk size: 1,000,000 / 10 = 100,000 per partition
   
   Step 2: Driver creates SQL queries for each partition
     Partition 0: SELECT * FROM table WHERE id >= 0 AND id < 100000
     Partition 1: SELECT * FROM table WHERE id >= 100000 AND id < 200000
     Partition 2: SELECT * FROM table WHERE id >= 200000 AND id < 300000
     ... and so on
   
   Step 3: Each executor opens separate connection to database
     - Executor 1 runs query for partitions [0, 5]
     - Executor 2 runs query for partitions [1, 6]
     - Executor 3 runs query for partitions [2, 7]
     - Executor 4 runs query for partitions [3, 8]
     - Executor 1 runs query for partitions [4, 9]
   
   RESULT: 10 parallel queries to database, each fetching 100K rows

3. CREATING DATA WITH range():
   ----------------------------
   df = spark.range(0, 1000000, numPartitions=8)
   
   WHAT HAPPENS:
   Step 1: Driver calculates partition boundaries
     - Total numbers: 1,000,000 (0 to 999,999)
     - Number of partitions: 8
     - Numbers per partition: 1,000,000 / 8 = 125,000
   
   Step 2: Driver creates partition specifications
     Partition 0: Generate numbers [0 to 124,999]
     Partition 1: Generate numbers [125,000 to 249,999]
     Partition 2: Generate numbers [250,000 to 374,999]
     ... and so on
   
   Step 3: Executors generate data locally (no network transfer!)
     - Each executor generates its assigned range
     - Data created in memory on executor
     - No shuffling or data movement needed

4. REPARTITIONING (Changing Partition Count):
   -------------------------------------------
   df_new = df.repartition(16)  # Increase from 8 to 16
   
   WHAT HAPPENS:
   Step 1: Shuffle! (Expensive operation)
     - All data redistributed across network
     - Each record assigned to new partition
     - Uses hash function: partition = hash(record) % 16
   
   Step 2: Driver creates shuffle tasks
     - Map stage: Each old partition writes data to 16 files
       (1 file per new partition)
     - Reduce stage: Each new partition reads its files from
       all map tasks
   
   Example with 8 old partitions, 16 new partitions:
     Old Partition 0 writes 16 files (one per new partition)
     Old Partition 1 writes 16 files
     ... 8 old partitions × 16 files = 128 shuffle files
     
     New Partition 0 reads file-0 from all 8 old partitions
     New Partition 1 reads file-1 from all 8 old partitions
     ... and so on
   
   RESULT: All data reshuffled across network
   
   COST: High! Involves:
     - Disk writes (128 files)
     - Network transfer (all data)
     - Disk reads (by new partitions)

5. COALESCE (Reducing Partitions WITHOUT Shuffle):
   ------------------------------------------------
   df_new = df.coalesce(4)  # Reduce from 8 to 4
   
   WHAT HAPPENS:
   Step 1: NO shuffle! Just merge partitions
     - Partition 0 + Partition 4 → New Partition 0
     - Partition 1 + Partition 5 → New Partition 1
     - Partition 2 + Partition 6 → New Partition 2
     - Partition 3 + Partition 7 → New Partition 3
   
   Step 2: Data stays on same executors
     - No network transfer
     - No disk writes
     - Just logical combination
   
   RESULT: Fast! No shuffling
   LIMITATION: Can only reduce, not increase partitions

PARTITION CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
====================================

spark.default.parallelism
--------------------------
Default number of partitions for RDDs from transformations like:
  - parallelize()
  - union()
  - coalesce()

Default value: 
  - Local mode: Number of cores on local machine
  - Cluster mode: max(2, total cores in cluster)

Example:
  conf.set("spark.default.parallelism", "200")

spark.sql.shuffle.partitions
-----------------------------
Number of partitions for shuffles in SQL/DataFrame operations:
  - groupBy()
  - join()
  - repartition()
  - window functions

Default value: 200

Example:
  conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "100")

When to change:
  - Small data (< 1GB): Set to 50-100
  - Medium data (1-10GB): Set to 100-200
  - Large data (> 10GB): Set to 200-500
  - Very large data (> 100GB): Set to 500-2000

Rule of thumb:
  - Each partition should be 100-200MB
  - Total partitions = Total data size / 128MB
  - Partitions should be 2-3x number of total cores

spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes
----------------------------------
Maximum bytes per partition when reading files.

Default: 128MB (134,217,728 bytes)

Example:
  conf.set("spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes", "67108864")  # 64MB

Smaller partitions:
  ✅ More parallelism
  ✅ Better for skewed data
  ❌ More task overhead
  ❌ More shuffle files

Larger partitions:
  ✅ Less task overhead
  ✅ Fewer shuffle files
  ❌ Less parallelism
  ❌ Risk of OOM if partition too large

PARTITION SKEW - THE #1 PERFORMANCE KILLER:
============================================

WHAT IS DATA SKEW?
------------------
Uneven distribution of data across partitions.

Example: groupBy('country') on user data
  Partition 0 (USA): 10,000,000 records → Takes 10 minutes
  Partition 1 (Canada): 1,000,000 records → Takes 1 minute
  Partition 2 (UK): 800,000 records → Takes 48 seconds
  Partition 3 (Australia): 500,000 records → Takes 30 seconds

PROBLEM: Job takes 10 minutes (limited by slowest partition)
Even though 3 partitions finish quickly!

HOW TO DETECT SKEW:
-------------------
1. Check Spark UI → Stages → Tasks
   - Look for tasks with much longer duration
   - Look for tasks processing more data

2. Check partition sizes:
   df.groupBy(spark_partition_id()).count().show()

HOW TO FIX SKEW:
----------------
1. Salting (Add random key):
   df = df.withColumn("salt", (rand() * 10).cast("int"))
   df = df.groupBy("country", "salt").agg(...)
   df = df.groupBy("country").agg(...)  # Final aggregation

2. Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) - Spark 3.0+:
   spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
   spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")
   
   AQE automatically:
   - Detects skewed partitions
   - Splits them into smaller partitions
   - Reoptimizes join strategies

3. Custom partitioning:
   df.repartition("country", "region")  # Partition by 2 columns

CACHED PARTITIONS - HOW CACHING WORKS:
=======================================

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CACHE:
-----------------------------
df.cache()  # or df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)

Step 1: Marking for Cache
  - DataFrame marked as "to be cached"
  - No data actually cached yet (lazy!)
  - Just sets a flag in metadata

Step 2: First Action Triggers Materialization
  df.count()  # This triggers cache
  
  WHAT HAPPENS ON EACH EXECUTOR:
  
  Executor 1 (holds partitions [0, 4]):
    1. Computes partition 0
    2. Stores result in Storage Memory (40% of heap)
    3. Computes partition 4
    4. Stores result in Storage Memory
    5. If memory full: Spills to disk or evicts old data (LRU)
  
  Executor 2 (holds partitions [1, 5]):
    1. Computes partition 1
    2. Stores in memory
    3. Computes partition 5
    4. Stores in memory
  
  ... and so on for all executors

Step 3: Subsequent Actions Use Cache
  df.filter(...).count()  # Reads from cache!
  
  Executor 1:
    1. Reads partition 0 from memory (fast!)
    2. Applies filter
    3. Counts
    4. Reads partition 4 from memory
    5. Applies filter
    6. Counts

WHERE IS CACHED DATA STORED?
-----------------------------
Location depends on StorageLevel:

MEMORY_ONLY (default for df.cache()):
  - Stored in executor JVM heap
  - Storage Memory region (40% of heap by default)
  - Deserialized objects (faster access)
  - Evicted if memory full (recomputed on next access)

MEMORY_ONLY_SER:
  - Stored in executor JVM heap
  - Serialized bytes (saves space, ~5x compression)
  - Slightly slower access (deserialization needed)
  - Fits 5x more data in same memory

MEMORY_AND_DISK:
  - First tries memory
  - If memory full, spills to disk
  - Disk location: spark.local.dir (temp directory)
  - File format: Blocks stored as files

DISK_ONLY:
  - Directly to disk
  - No memory used
  - Slower than memory (disk I/O)

OFF_HEAP:
  - Stored outside JVM heap
  - Requires spark.memory.offHeap.enabled=true
  - Avoids GC overhead
  - Useful for large caches

MEMORY LAYOUT ON EXECUTOR:
---------------------------
Total Executor Memory (e.g., 4GB):
├─ Reserved Memory (300MB)
│  └─ Internal Spark overhead
├─ Execution Memory (60% of remaining = 2.22GB)
│  ├─ Shuffles
│  ├─ Joins
│  ├─ Sorts
│  └─ Aggregations
└─ Storage Memory (40% of remaining = 1.48GB)
   ├─ Cached RDDs/DataFrames ← YOUR CACHED DATA HERE
   ├─ Broadcast variables
   └─ Temporary blocks

CACHE EVICTION POLICY:
-----------------------
When Storage Memory fills up:
1. LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
2. Oldest cached partition removed first
3. Evicted data recomputed on next access
4. Only evicts entire partitions (not partial)

CACHE MANAGEMENT:
-----------------
df.unpersist()  # Remove from cache
  - Frees memory immediately
  - Next access will recompute
  - Good practice when done with DataFrame

spark.catalog.clearCache()  # Clear all caches
  - Nuclear option
  - Frees all cached data
  - Use when memory is critical

APPLICATION LIFECYCLE - DETAILED:
==================================

PHASE 1: SUBMISSION
-------------------
Command: spark-submit --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster my_app.py

Step 1: Parse Command Line
  • spark-submit reads arguments
  • Validates application files exist
  • Determines cluster manager type
  • Chooses deploy mode (client vs cluster)

Step 2: Package Application
  • Bundles Python files
  • Uploads to distributed storage (HDFS/S3)
  • Creates application JAR (if Scala/Java)

Step 3: Contact Cluster Manager
  • Opens connection to cluster manager
  • Submits application request
  • Includes: resource requirements, files, configs

PHASE 2: DRIVER LAUNCH
----------------------
CLIENT MODE:
  • Driver starts immediately on client machine
  • SparkContext initialized locally
  • Connects to cluster manager
  • Requests executor resources

CLUSTER MODE:
  Step 1: Cluster Manager Allocates Driver Container
    • YARN: Allocates ApplicationMaster container
    • K8s: Creates Driver pod
    • Standalone: Allocates on Worker node
  
  Step 2: Driver Process Starts
    • JVM starts with driver memory
    • Loads application code
    • Initializes SparkContext
    • Registers with cluster manager
  
  Step 3: Driver Requests Executors
    • Calculates: num_executors × (executor_memory + executor_cores)
    • Sends request to cluster manager
    • Waits for executor allocation

PHASE 3: EXECUTOR LAUNCH
-------------------------
Step 1: Cluster Manager Allocates Resources
  YARN:
    • ResourceManager checks queue capacity
    • Allocates containers on NodeManagers
    • Considers data locality preferences
  
  K8s:
    • Scheduler finds nodes with capacity
    • Creates Executor pods
    • Assigns to nodes via kubelet
  
  Standalone:
    • Master allocates executor slots on Workers
    • Workers launch executor processes

Step 2: Executors Start
  • JVM starts with executor memory
  • Initializes executor backend
  • Connects to Driver
  • Sends registration message

Step 3: Driver Acknowledges Executors
  • Receives executor registration
  • Adds executor to available resources
  • Marks executor as ready for tasks
  • Updates task scheduler

PHASE 4: TASK EXECUTION
------------------------
Step 1: Action Triggers Job
  • User code calls action (count(), collect(), save())
  • Driver creates job
  • Analyzes dependencies (DAG)

Step 2: Driver Creates Stages & Tasks
  • Splits DAG at shuffle boundaries (stages)
  • Creates tasks (1 per partition per stage)
  • Considers data locality

Step 3: Driver Schedules Tasks
  • Assigns tasks to executors
  • Serializes task code + closure
  • Sends tasks via RPC

Step 4: Executors Run Tasks
  • Deserialize task
  • Execute on partition data
  • Store intermediate results
  • Report progress to driver

Step 5: Shuffle (if needed)
  • Executors write shuffle data to disk
  • Executors fetch shuffle data from peers
  • No driver involvement in data transfer

Step 6: Driver Collects Results
  • Executors send results to driver
  • Driver aggregates final result
  • Returns to user code

PHASE 5: APPLICATION COMPLETION
--------------------------------
Normal Completion:
  Step 1: Driver Calls stop()
    • SparkContext.stop() invoked
    • Sends shutdown to executors
  
  Step 2: Executors Shutdown
    • Flush cached data
    • Close connections
    • Exit process
  
  Step 3: Driver Unregisters
    • Notifies cluster manager
    • Releases resources
    • Exits

Failure:
  • Driver failure → entire app fails
  • Executor failure → tasks rescheduled
  • Cluster manager failure → varies by manager

    # STEP 3: ACTION TRIGGERS JOB
    # ========================================================================
    # WHAT HAPPENS WHEN count() IS CALLED:
    #
    # A. Driver - Job Creation:
    #    1. Identifies action (count)
    #    2. Analyzes DAG for this action
    #    3. Creates Job object
    #    4. Assigns job ID
    #
    # B. Driver - Stage Creation:
    #    1. Finds shuffle boundaries in DAG
    #    2. Splits into stages at shuffles
    #    3. Creates Stage objects
    #    4. Determines stage dependencies
    #    5. For count(): Usually single stage (no shuffle)
    #
    # C. Driver - Task Creation:
    #    1. For each stage:
    #       - Count number of partitions (default: spark.default.parallelism)
    #       - Create 1 task per partition
    #       - Example: 200 partitions → 200 tasks
    #    2. Assigns task IDs
    #    3. Determines task locality preferences

    # D. Driver - Task Serialization:
    #    1. For each task:
    #       - Serialize task function (closure)
    #       - Serialize any broadcast variables referenced
    #       - Create Task object
    #       - Package: function + partition info + dependencies
    #    2. Size typically: 1-10 KB per task

    #       - Next: RACK_LOCAL (data on same rack)
    #       - Last: ANY (data on different rack)
    #    2. Assign tasks to executors
    #    3. Queue tasks if executors busy
    #
    # F. Driver - Task Distribution:

    #
    # C. Task Execution:
    #    1. Get partition data (from memory/disk/network)
    #    2. Create iterator over partition records
    #    3. Apply transformations in pipeline:
    #       For each record:
    #         - Apply filter: if id > 500000
    #         - Apply withColumn: squared = id * id
    #         - Count if passed filter
    #    4. No intermediate materialization
    #    5. Process records one at a time (iterator model)
    #
    # D. Result Collection:
    #    1. Task completes with result (count from this partition)
    #    2. Serialize result
    #    3. Send result back to driver
    #    4. Report task metrics (time, memory, etc.)
